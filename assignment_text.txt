GenAI Task: Build an SHL Assessment Recommendation System 
Why are we asking you to do this assessment? 
We use this assessment to evaluate the following core skills: 
1. Problem-Solving 
 Ability to understand and synthesize the problem, decompose it into manageable components, and 
design a solution that is coherent, scalable, and meaningful. 
2. Programming Skills 
 Ability to write clean, effective, and reliable code to solve the problem. This includes appropriate use 
of AI-assisted tools to accelerate development without compromising correctness or understanding. 
3. Context Engineering 
 Ability to deeply understand the provided context, constraints, and data, and leverage them to 
produce solutions that are accurate, relevant, and well-aligned with the problem requirements. 
Indicators of Unsuccessful Submissions 
Based on our experience evaluating thousands of such assessments, candidates are unlikely to be successful 
if: 
1. Insufficient programming skills and experience  
 Core programming skills are not strong enough to implement a robust, maintainable, and extensible 
solution. 
2. Vibe-coding is great but not replacement for foundations  
 The solution relies on “vibe-coding” or trial-and-error without demonstrating a deep understanding 
of the problem, assumptions, and trade-offs. 
3. Limited validation/testing rigor  
 The solution is not tested across a sufficiently diverse set of inputs, edge cases, or realistic queries to 
demonstrate reliability and generalizability. 
Brief overview of hiring process  
Our hiring process consists of the following stages: 
1. Take-Home Assessment 
 Evaluation of problem-solving ability, Gen AI programming skills, and context engineering. 
2. First-Round Interview 
We take a deep-dive on your submission and do a technical discussion on different aspects i.e. 
reasoning behind design choices, and core programming fundamentals including live problem-
solving and adaptation of solutions under changing constraints. 
3. Second-Round Interview 
Discussion of experience, projects, and previous problem-solving experience.  
4. Third-Round Interview 
Technical/Non-Technical discussion with hiring manager for understanding role alignment and 
motivation. 
 
 
Problem Overview 
Hiring managers and recruiters often struggle to find the right assessments for the roles that they are hiring 
for. The current system relies on keyword searches and filters, making the process time-consuming and 
inefficient. Your task is to build an intelligent recommendation system that simplifies this process. Given a 
natural language query or a job description (JD) text or an URL (containing a JD), your application 
should return a list of relevant SHL assessments. 
You can take a look at the data sources that you are going to work with here, 
https://www.shl.com/solutions/products/product-catalog/ 
Your Task 
Design and develop a web application that: 
1. Takes a given natural language query or job description text URL 
2. Recommends minimum 5 (maximum 10) most relevant “individual test solutions” from here 
in the tabular format. Please note that you need to ignore “Pre-packaged Job Solutions” category 
from this link 
3. Each recommendation needs to have at least the following attributes 
– Assessment name 
– URL (as given in SHL’s catalog) 
 
Datasets Given 
 
1. The actual data over which you need to build the recommendation engine can be found: link 
a. You need to crawl the assessment catalogue from the SHL website to be able to build this 
solution. 
b. Make sure that there are at least 377 Individual Test Solutions after crawling to the given 
website. 
c. Build the recommendation system by leveraging this downloaded data. 
2. Once you have build your first solution you can use train data provided to validate and iterate over it. 
a. Datasets can be found at: link 
i. Labelled Train set: This contains a set of 10 queries labeled by humans, most 
relevant assessments from the catalog. This can be used to iterate over your 
prompts, improve your pipeline etc. 
b. You can use the labeled train data to iterate and improve your solution. 
3. Once you have finalized your solution, you need to generate prediction on the test set provided: 
a. Datasets can be found on the same url as above: link 
b. Unlabeled test set: This dataset contains a set of 9 queries – on which you have generate and 
submit predictions. 
Submission Materials 
You need to submit the following items using this form 
- 3 URLs,  
1. API end point which can be queried using a query or piece of text and returns result in 
JSON (API Configurations mentioned below in Appendix 2)  
2. URL of the code on GitHub which we can see (URL of the complete code - Including 
your experiments and evaluation) 
3. URL of the web application frontend to test the application 
- 2-page document outlining your approach on how you solved this problem. Most importantly, 
document the efforts you put into optimizing the overall performance score, including initial 
results and how you improved them. Write this document as concisely as possible with appropriate 
information 
- 1-csv file with 2 columns query and predictions (Format given in Appendix 3). The csv file should 
contain the predictions on the given unlabeled test set.  
 
These points are vital for us to evaluate the technical completeness and robustness of your solution: 
• Ensure that the API URL providing access to your recommendation engine is functional, your code 
is accessible via a public or private (shared with us) GitHub repository, and the csv file is in the 
correct format 
• A .csv file in the prescribed format runs over the given test set (Format given in Appendix 3) 
 
Evaluation Criteria (Core Logic) 
We will be using the following criteria to evaluate your solution.  
• Solution Approach 
• General Evaluation 
• We expect a clear and implementable strategy that directly addresses the 
problem statement. The code should reflect: 
• A well-defined pipeline connecting data ingestion, retrieval, and 
recommendation. 
• Logical flow between components (data → embedding → search → 
recommendation). 
• Modular, reproducible, and maintainable code structure. 
• Appropriate use of APIs, prompts, or models in line with the 
problem’s requirements. 
• Data Pipeline 
• We expect: 
• Implementation of a data ingestion pipeline that scrapes or retrieves 
SHL product information. 
• Clean parsing and structuring of product data (titles, categories, URLs, 
etc.). 
• Use of efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms e.g., embeddings or 
vector databases 
• Solutions built without scraping and storing SHL product catalogue from the 
website will be rejected 
• Technology Stack & LLM Integration 
• We expect: 
• Use of modern LLM-based or retrieval-augmented techniques for 
query understanding or recommendation generation. 
• Justifiable use of the chosen frameworks (Langfuse, LangChain, 
LlamaIndex, etc.) based on functionality  
• Solutions without clear LLM or retrieval-based integration will be rejected. 
• Evaluation  
• We expect: 
• Implementation of evaluation methods to measure system accuracy 
and effectiveness. 
• Evaluation applied to the right stages (retrieval and final 
recommendation). 
• We have provided you with train data. This train data is given to help 
you evaluate and iterate over your solution. 
• Solutions lacking measurable evaluation will be rejected. 
• Performance and Relevance 
• Recommendation Accuracy: The performance of assessment recommendation, measured 
by the Mean Recall@10 against the provided test set. 
• Recommendation Balance: The relevance and balance of recommended assessments 
based on query requirements. 
• Requirement: The system must intelligently balance recommendations when a 
query spans multiple domains. For instance, if a query pertains to both 
behavioral and technical skills, the results should contain a balanced mix of 
assessments. 
• Example Scenario: 
• Sample Query: "Need a Java developer who is good in collaborating 
with external teams and stakeholders." 
• Expected Outcome: The recommendation results should include a 
balanced set of assessments including hard and soft skills 
corresponding to both "Knowledge & Skills" (Test Type K) and 
"Personality & Behavior" (Test Type P) from the catalogue in this case. 
(Test Type is present in the catalogue)

recommendations, averaged across all test queries. 
Number of relevant assessments in top K 
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙@𝐾 = Total relevant assessments for the query 
𝑁 
1
